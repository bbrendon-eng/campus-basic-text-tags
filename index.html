            <p>
                When you have text displayed in a block with multiple lines, it's considered a paragraph.
                Paragraph text may contain <em>emphasized</em> words or phrases and other markup
                such as <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
                to convey meaning.

            <h2>Marking up Text in Blocks</h2>

            <p>
                It may happen that you have text, like a poem, that requires special formatting.
                You can use line break tags like <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> to ensure each line displays properly.
                These should not be used for layout; use CSS instead.

                <mark>Excerpt from <cite>The Raven</cite> by Edgar Allen Poe</mark><br>
                Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
                Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
                <mark>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping</mark><br>
                As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
            </p>

            <p>
                “'Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
                <mark>Only this and nothing more.</mark>"

            <h3>Marking Up Text to Convey Meaning</h3>

            <p>
                Sometimes you mark up small pieces of text, including single letters or words, to convey meaning.
                Highlighting search terms is common—for example, the user searched for
                <b>focus area</b> and the following paragraph was returned.
            </p>

            <p>
                The primary <i>focus area</i> must be chosen from one of the four GIT focus areas:
                Front-end Web Design and Development; Commercial Photography and Video; Digital Design; Print and Publishing;
                2D/3D Animation. The secondary focus area can be any topic that supports the student's career path.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags were used above.
                The <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> tag is less common because it resembles links, but it can be used
                to highlight speling errors.
