    <h2>Marking up Text in Blocks</h2>

    <p>
        When you have text that is displayed in a block, usually with multiple lines, it's considered a paragraph.
        Paragraph text can include words or phrases that are <em>emphasized</em> in some way, and
        they can contain links and other markup used for text (but not headings). Paragraphs are block-level elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        It may happen that you have text, like a poem, that requires some special formatting.
        You'd need to ensure that each line displays at a proper length, and you can do that with the
        line break tags such as <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>. These will not be used outside that purpose or for
        formatting an address in an <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> tag.
        Don't add line breaks to paragraphs, forms, or other page elements — use CSS for styling.
    </p>

    <p>
        Remember that you can use tags like <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> and
        <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> to convey meaning in text (these are not just to make text bold or italic; they add meaning).

        <mark>Excerpt from <cite>The Raven</cite> — a Poem by Edgar Allen Poe</mark><br>
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
        <mark>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</mark><br>
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
        “'Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
        <mark>Only this and nothing more.</mark>"

    <h3>Marking Up Text to Convey Meaning</h3>

    <p>
        Sometimes, you are marking up small pieces of text, including single letters and words,
        to convey some meaning. When doing this, you want to use the most appropriate tags you can.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if your page offered search results, it's likely you would highlight the terms
        the user searched for. If the user searched for <b>focus area</b> and the following
        paragraph was returned, those words should be highlighted in that paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary <i>focus area</i> must be chosen from one of the four GIT focus areas
        (Front-end Web Design and Development; Commercial Photography and Video; Digital Design;
        Print and Publishing; 2D/3D Animation). The secondary focus area can be any topic that will best
        aid the student's career path.
    </p>

    <p>
        We used the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags above, but we haven't talked about the
        <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> tag. These are not often used and can confuse users, as they underline text the same
        way links are styled by default. A good use for these is to highlight <mark>speling</mark> errors.
